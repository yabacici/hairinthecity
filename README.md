# Hair In The City App

I created 'Hair In The City' is my final project during a 3-month bootcamp at SPICED Academy.

This project is a **work in progress**.

## Overview

This is a fullstack React app.

### My idea

This is an app where users can look for a hairstylist nearby without creating a profile or register as a hairdresser and engage in conversation with other users.

### What can a user do?

-   Register
-   Log in
-   Chat
-   Look for other users
-   Locate user

## Built with

-   CSS
-   React
-   Redux
-   React Google API
-   Socket.io
-   Webpack
-   PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

```Console
npm install
```

## Screenshots
